In 1990 it was televised in a critically and popularly acclaimed television drama serial by the BBC in four parts from 18 November - 9 December 1990. The story was adapted by Andrew Davies. Dobbs's novel was also dramatised for radio for BBC World Service in 1996 by Neville Teller. The House of Cards trilogy was ranked 84th in the British Film Institute list of the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes.Overview The antihero of House of Cards is a fictional Conservative Chief Whip Francis Urquhart (the entire concept came from the initials 'F.U.') played by Ian Richardson. The plot follows his amoral and manipulative scheme to become leader of the governing party and hence Prime Minister of the UK. It appears that Dobbs did not envisage writing the second and third books. The screenplay of the BBC's dramatisation of House of Cards had to differ from the book in order to allow future series. Dobbs wrote two following books To Play the King and The Final Cut which were televised in 1993 and 1995 respectively. House of Cards draws heavily from Shakespeare's Macbeth and Richard III both of which examine issues of power unbridled ambition and corruption. Richardson said he based his performance of the scheming Francis Urquhart on the way Shakespeare portrayed Richard III.\"I couldn't possibly comment\" Frequently during the drama Urquhart talks through the camera to the audience breaking the fourth wall. The drama also introduced and popularised the phrase: 'You may very well think that; I couldn't possibly comment'.

Colin Firth and Ben Barnes rise to that standard in this truly compelling adaptation offering first Wilde's sparkling wit then a plunge into gothic horror.\n\nWhen the handsome and naive Dorian (Barnes) arrives in Victorian London he befriends the charismatic Lord Henry Wotton (Firth) who introduces him to a world of excess. For Henry the only things worth pursuing in life are beauty and fulfillment of the senses views he imparts to Dorian together with a good deal of flattery.\n\nWomen are enamoured of Dorian's youthful countenance but so is artist Basil Hallward (Ben Chaplin) a friend of Henry's who paints Dorian's portrait aiming to capture all the power and allure of physical beauty. Overtaken with his own vanity Dorian decides he would rather sell his soul than see himself age another day. Soon after just such a deal presents itself with the stipulation that every sin marked upon his soul would render itself visible on Basil's painting. Disregarding consequences Dorian descends into debauchery. He seduces the beautiful performer Sibyl Vane (Rachel Hurd-Wood) and then abandons her. He woos a host of stunning women attends erotically charged costume parties and indulges in whatever fancy suits his whim. Yet Dorian is continually haunted by the true nature of his appearance.\n\nOliver Parker has forged a career adapting the works of Oscar Wilde to the screen; with Dorian Gray he takes a compelling revisionist approach freeing this adaptation from the restraint typical of period pieces and emphasizing the hedonistic impulses that were the central thrust of Wilde's original novel. Though set in a lost era the film's exploration of double lives feels thoroughly contemporary. Long before the Internet made duplicity such a common trait of social interaction Wilde could shock Victorian society with the notion that a gentleman could be hideously deformed on the inside and a paragon of beauty without.\"\nQuoting the 2009 TIFF site"}]"name":"Dorian Gray""type":"/media_common/adaptation""id":"/wikipedia/it/Dorian_Gray_$0028film$0029"} redoneMovieRating : 7(6.3)  bookRating : 4.02

{"/common/topic/description":[{"lang":"/lang/en""value":"A Single Man is a romantic drama film written by Tom Ford and David Scearce and directed by Tom Ford.\n\n\"Tom Ford's historical importance (to date) rests in part on his unique collaborations with the late twentieth century's great commercial photographers: Richard Avedon Steven Meisel Helmut Newton Herb Ritts and so on. With them he championed the idea that style could govern our memories without an appeal to straightforward nostalgia. Evidence of this same balance of past and present can also be found in the clothes he famously created at Gucci. Ford drew from the past in ways that clearly distinguish tribute from innovation evoking both technological change and the timeless truths of the human form.\n\nIn his first feature film Ford continues along this rich and aesthetically complex pathway using the recent history of the photographic image to tell a story both historical and bracingly contemporary. The setting is Southern California and our moment in time is officially the early sixties. We meet George Falconer (Colin Firth) a gay college professor as he learns that his lover Jim (Matthew Goode) has died in a car wreck. Grief overwhelms him and his ?invisible status? in society begins to close in again. Suicide seems the best way out. But a mad night with Charley (Julianne Moore) his best girlfriend from England and the unexpected attentions of an angora-sweater-clad young man make George think twice.\n\nBased on a late-career Christopher Isherwood novel told largely through flashback and featuring alarmingly precise attention to period detail in furniture costume and architecture A Single Man could easily have felt like a throwback a work of atavism. But Ford pulls this pre-AIDS tale of gay love and loss into our age by reminding us again of what is eternal in life love and how we choose to forgive. The film deliberately reveals how George pulls himself from the narcissism of self-sacrifice to an understanding of his value to the world and the people around him. Ford seems to be gently insisting that the rich and complex personal histories of gay men from any age must be part of the political calculations of our time. A Single Man confirms this artist's ongoing impact on our culture and our awareness of our place within it.\"\nQuoting Noah Cowan."}]"name":"A Single Man""type":"/media_common/adaptation""id":"/wikipedia/es_id/2915941"} redoneMovieRating : 9(7.6), redoneBookRating : 10(4.1),

For Ashes of Time Redux the whole film was put back in the post-production mill with a result that appeals to ear and eye.\n\nAlthough sometimes described as Wong Kar Wai's adaptation of the Jin Yong novel Legend of the Condor Heroes it would probably be more accurate to call Ashes of Time the wuxia version of Days of Being Wild. Despite marking his first venture into wuxia Ashes of Time saw Wong disregard the conventions of the genre in favour of probing into the lives of the three heroes drawing out sentimental themes of love and loss. The use of voice over driving multiple plot lines the monologue quality of the dialogues the baroque quality of its music and the self-conscious lyricism of its images have all added to the defamiliarisation of wuxia conventions. Although the three major battle scenes are choreographed differently each one does away with the traditional wuxia conventions of movements and battle arrays. Without a doubt Ashes of Time is an auteur film that shows the wuxia genre in a whole new light.\"\nQuoting the description from the 2011 International Film Festival Rotterdam site."}]} redoneMovieRating : 8(7.2), redoneBookRating : 10(4.1),

But in Columbia Pictures' \n30 Days of Night based on the groundbreaking graphic novel that's all \nabout to change. Not your parents' vampires these are eating machines built \nfor one purpose -- to devour human beings -- and only daylight can stop them... \nwhich is why they target the remote isolated town of Barrow Alaska which each \nwinter is plunged into a state of complete darkness that lasts 30 days. The \ncunning bloodthirsty vampires relishing in a month of free rein are set to \ntake advantage feeding on the helpless residents. It is up to Sheriff Eben \n(Josh Hartnett) his estranged wife Stella (Melissa George) and an \never-shrinking group of survivors to do anything and everything they can to last \nuntil daylight.\n\nABOUT THE FILM\n\n\n\n30 Days of\nNight began its journey to theaters\nwith the publication of the graphic novel by Steve Niles and Ben\nTemplesmith. The miniseries ? just three\nbooks ? became a career-defining moment for both. As they brought both a new look and a new\nstory to the vampire legend Niles?\nand Templesmith?s work has been lauded as a revival of the horror comic. \n\n\n\n?We fell in love with the idea of vampires coming to\nBarrow Alaska once the sun has set for a month? says producer Rob Tapert\nwho ? with producer Sam Raimi ? founded Ghost House Productions to bring this\nkind of story to the screen. ?It was a\nproject that got us excited because it delivers a level of intensity and\nstylized horror that as a young guy I loved in these kinds of movies and to\nthis day I still enjoy. For Sam and me 30 Days of Night is a return to our Evil Dead roots.?\n\n\n\nTo direct Raimi and Tapert tapped David Slade whose\nfirst film the independent Hard Candy\nimpressed them. ?David has a style and way of working unique unto him? Tapert\nsays. ?He has a very specific idea of\nwhat he wants and how he wants everything to be and then he finds a way to work\nthis out with the actors. He is a\nbeliever in lots of tight shots close-ups with attention to details which\nfrenetically ramp up his movie.?\n\n\n\nThe director says that long before getting involved\nwith 30 Days of Night he had bought the first edition of the graphic\nnovel. ?I love Ben Templesmith?s artwork\n? especially the image of Eben looking out and seeing the vampires for the\nfirst time? he says. ?After I directed\nmy first film I had a meeting in which an executive at Columbia Pictures\nmentioned that they owned the property.\nI said ?Hang on a minute. I\nwould chew off my arm to do that!??\n\n\n\nThe graphic novel is credited with reinvigorating the\nvampire genre. Though the creature dates\nback to Lord Byron in Western literature ? and is many centuries older in other\ncultures ? the vampire had in Niles?\nand Templesmith?s opinions lost its horror.\nThe authors saw 30 Days of Night\nas an opportunity to steer the genre back to its roots and away from the\ngothic affected vampires that had taken over their favorite monsters. ?One of the things\nBen and I really wanted to do was make vampires scary again? says Niles. ?We?ve seen vampires made into Count\nChocula. Teenage girls are dating\nthem. These should be feral vampires\nthat see humans as nothing more than something to feed on. And Ben took that ten steps further with the\nlook of the book.?\n\n\n\n?I was going for pure savagery with just a hint of\nalien? says Templesmith. ?The classic\nimage of the vampire is the goth romantic ponce. I wanted eating machines.?\n\n\n\nOne of the filmmakers? top goals was to bring the\nsource material?s striking imagery to life.\n?I wanted the look of the film to be very close to Ben Templesmith?s\nartwork which I very much liked? Slade says.\n\n\n\n\nTemplesmith says that the filmmakers achieved that\nvision. ?Within reason they?ve taken\nthe look of the movie from the page. The\ncolor?s stripped back the vampires look like the vampires in the book ?..."}]} redoneMovieRating : 7(6.6)  bookRating : 4.08

When his bar is empty Moe finds out that is where all his customers have gone and he goes to join them. With a capacity crowd plus one on hand Chief Wiggum has to send someone away and he selects Moe. As a result Moe is one of the only ones to not be driven out of town by the obnoxious and somewhat lethal (to other plant life) smell of the Sumatran Century Flower when it finally does bloom. The mass exodus from Springfield results in a huge traffic jam on the Springfield Bridge. When traffic begins to move Homer hits the accelerator only to have to immediately slam on the brakes because traffic didn't move that far. The quick stop to family car and the faulty seat restraint that was holding Maggie in the backseat causes her to be launch through the sunroof and over the side of the bridge. She lands in the arms of Moe who was perched on the side of the bridge ready to commit suicide. Moe becomes a hero. Moe stops by to see Maggie and winds up watching her when Marge needs to care of Grampa who's out on the street acting crazier than normal. Moe becomes Maggie's fulltime babysitter. Moe entertains Maggie by telling her a story; of course it's \"The Godfather\" saga. Late in the evening after Maggie's birthday party where Homer began to learn that Maggie prefers Moe over him Marge and Homer hear Maggie crying. They go to her room only to find Moe already there calming her down. They forbid him to ever see her again. The next day Moe is lonely and missing Maggie. That night outside her window Maggie overhears Fat Tony and his boys plan to take out the Castellaneta family. She crawls out her window and begins pursuing them. Marge discovers Maggie is gone and they immediately suspect Moe. When Moe doesn't have her and he finds out she is missing he offers to help. Clues outside Maggie's window reveal that the mob was gathered outside of her window and Moe suggests that they might find her in little Italy. At a restaurant in Little Italy Maggie finds she is in the middle of an \"Italian-American Mexican standoff.\" Moe volunteers to go in and rescue her. He draws the mobster's attention to Maggie which causes them to all go soft. Moe returns Maggie to Homer and Marge and prepares to leave; only Maggie doesn't want him to go. Homer and Marge agree that Moe can have the occasional play date with Maggie provided he brings along his ham to accompany Homer."}]} redoneMovieRating : 8(7.3), redoneBookRating : 8(3.4),

Featuring a cast that includes both acclaimed and emerging Australian actors and musicians the story of one young Aboriginal man's search for love and his true identity can finally reach audiences all over the world.\n\nIt's the summer of 1969 in Broome an idyllic spot on Australia's west coast. Sixteen-year-old Willie (Rocky McKenzie) just wants to hang out with his friends. When he gets up the courage he also wants to invite the beautiful local church singer Rosie (Jessica Mauboy) out to the movies. But these typical teenaged pursuits must wait as Willie is about to leave for Catholic boarding school in Perth at the wishes of his deeply devout mother.\n\nLife at the boarding school under the oppressive and condescending leadership of Father Benedictus (Geoffrey Rush) soon chafes however and Willie rebels bolting for freedom. Alone in the city he has no survival skills. He eventually finds a mentor in Uncle Tadpole (Ernie Dingo) an errant former resident of Broome. Tadpole insists on accompanying Willie back home and the pair hitch a ride with the hippie Annie (Missy Higgins) and a German tourist Slippery (Tom Budge). In the meantime Father Benedictus has hit the highway in search of Willie determined to return him to school.\n\nUnderneath the film's road movie/romantic comedy veneer is a story about identity and culture and how each person needs to navigate those stony shores individually. The latter half of the sixties is a fitting era for such a philosophical search and production designer Felicity Abbott captures it perfectly. Photography by Andrew Lesnie (who won an Academy Award? for The Fellowship of the Ring) showcases both the stunning Australian landscapes and the compelling visage of Willie as he tries to maintain his emotional footing amid the chaos that surrounds him. Hats off to director Rachel Perkins for shepherding one of Australia's finest stage productions to the screen.\"\nQuoting Jane Schoettle on the 2009 TIFF site."}]} redoneMovieRating : 7(6.3), redoneBookRating : 7(2.6),

Miss G tells her students at an elite British boarding school in 1934 ?is desire.? She needn't have spelled it out. As played by the spectacularly cool Eva Green Miss G is the walking embodiment of desire. She smokes flouts the headmistress's rules and hints at dark European adventures in her past. She even wears trousers. Determined to awaken in her girls a yearning for something more Miss G encourages free thinking late-night parties and the almost erotic freedom of diving lessons at the lake.\n\nThe girls are thrilled at first to have such an inspiring teacher but cracks begin to appear. Miss G begins to disturb the students' rigid and remorseless power structure. Top mean girl Di Radfield (Juno Temple) feels especially threatened and Di does not respond well to threats. Then a new girl arrives from Spain. Even compared to Miss G Fiamma (Maria Valverde) is exotic. Beautiful dark and supremely sophisticated she is a princess among mere pretenders. Everyone begins to compete for her favour.\n\nCracks marks the feature debut of Jordan Scott and it's clear she already possesses a command of the camera and her performers. Casual observers might note that as the daughter of Sir Ridley Scott she grew up breathing cinema. Perhaps so but what stands out here goes beyond craft. As Miss G tries to navigate the girls' shifting lines of allegiance Scott builds contrasting moods of unease and sensuality from the very first scene. She also shows enormous confidence in letting that mood play out until she is ready to unleash its consequences. When Cracks opens up at its climax to the full cost of Miss G's pronouncements on desire the result is nothing short of shocking.\"\nQuoting Mich?le Maheux on the 2009 TIFF site.""lang":"/lang/en"}]} redoneMovieRating : 8(6.7), redoneBookRating : 8(3.4),

They search for a way out of the mine and discover a wall filled with large diamonds. Unfortunately the floor they are standing on can't hold their weight and they fall down a volcano tube for miles and miles until they reach the center of the earth. Once there they encounter prehistoric glow birds flying piranha man-eating plants and T-Rex dinosaurs that have been extinct for millions of years.

Gene is bright but introspective while Finny is outgoing and athletic but not a distinguished scholar. Gene and Finny strike up a friendship and Gene finds that Finny's charm and charisma begins to rub off on him. However Gene also finds that his more active social life is putting damper on his schoolwork and his fondness for Finny fades into a distrust and resentment as he begins to believe that the poorer student wants to bring him down to his intellectual level. The rift between Gene and Finny continues to grow until it manifests itself in a shocking act that will change them both forever.

After two years in a welfare residence for boys where daily survival literally means a fight he is eager to get back to the family farm in Saskatchewan. But the only people happy to see him are his Aunt Matilda (Gabrielle Rose) and another young outcast Johnny Swift (Alexander De Jordy). When Snit is unable to cultivate his family's rock-strewn fields he turns to Johnny's bootlegging operation to get the farm back into working order. However the tough-as-nails local cop Roy Kane (John Pyper-Ferguson) is on the lookout for the person who's been brewing moonshine and all he needs is one more reason to send Snit back to the home for boys. Already on the run from a community that doesn't want them Snit and Johnny take drastic steps to escape the foothills.\n\nIn classic western fashion HUNGRY HILLS follows an outlaw and his sidekick as they are hunted by a local sheriff their flight set against a stunningly photographed natural landscape. Instead of lush valleys and rock formations this is a barren wasteland and their desolate surroundings provide a stark reflection of financial desperation. Immaculate art direction transforms the fifties into a character of its own crowding the people and forcing their actions. Sterling performances by the cast support the film's gorgeous and memorable visual palette.\n\nMore than forty years after the book was initially published George Ryga's story feels fresh again in this cinematic form. The film offers a grim portrayal of the decay of morality at the hands of money and its themes of survival and dogged determination are perfectly situated in the current global context. In the vein of modern westerns like There Will Be Blood heroism and redemption are only revealed after grisly events and George Ryga's HUNGRY HILLS finds these qualities in unlikely places and people. This is among the most inventive and polished Canadian literary adaptations in recent memory.\"\nQuoting Jesse Wente on the 2009 TIFF site."}]"type":"/media_common/adaptation""name":"George Ryga's HUNGRY HILLS"} redoneMovieRating : 9(7.6)  bookRating : 4.00

{"/common/topic/description":[{"lang":"/lang/en""value":"Cool It is a 2010 documentary film written by Terry Botwick Sarah Gibson Ondi Timoner and directed by Ondi Timoner.\n\n\"Bjorn Lomborg is a provocative contrarian. He won unusual prominence for a Danish academic by writing The Skeptical Environmentalist an international bestseller that questioned assumptions about environmental decline. Many critics weighed in harshly asserting that Lomborg?s credentials as a political scientist didn?t make him an expert on environmental science. But Lomborg stood his ground amassed data to counterattack and became a voice to be reckoned with. As an openly gay vegetarian who often challenges liberal doctrine he remains hard to pigeonhole politically.\n\nIn Cool It he enters the contentious debate over global warming amplifying points that he raised in a book of the same title. Lomborg doesn?t deny that climate change is occurring but he believes activists need fresh responses. He takes issue with Al Gore and finds fault with prevailing strategies to control carbon emissions. Focusing on the world?s growing energy needs Lomborg tours laboratories of future technologies such as water splitting algae fuel and wave energy. He also raises the possibility to mitigate climate change through geo-engineering with experimental techniques such as cloud brightening. Whether you accept his views or not the film brings a heady sense of urgency to confronting a global crisis.\n\nDirector Ondi Timoner has proven herself a versatile filmmaker with larger-than-life characters in DIG! about a rock and roll rivalry and We Live in Public about an Internet visionary. Both films won the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival. In Cool It she briskly covers extensive territory delving into Lomborg?s background as a Green Peace loyalist turned dissident and detailing the free speech fight that nearly destroyed his career. She synthesizes Lomborg?s ideas with punchy visuals and includes testimony from his opponents including Stephen Schneider the Stanford University climatologist who recently died. Firing off ideas like a tennis ball machine Lomborg comes across as eager for debate. This film should give him plenty more occasions to engage.\"\nQuoting Thom Powers from the 2010 Toronto International Film Festival site."}]"name":"Cool It""type":"/media_common/adaptation""id":"/wikipedia/en_title/Cool_It_$0028film$0029"} redoneMovieRating : 8(6.8), redoneBookRating : 9(3.7),

He was acquitted when the court decided that it was his business partner who was responsible. Keller and his family desperately await the post-war return of son Larry who was officially listed as missing in action. Larry's fiance Ann (Joan Allen) the daughter of Keller's imprisoned business partner is attracted to Larry's brother Chris (Aidan Quinn) but she has vowed to remain faithful to her missing fiance. The play's third act reveals that it was indeed Joe Keller and not his partner who was responsible for the defective material -- and that his penny-pinching carelessness ended up costing the life of his own son Larry.

Reigning the national box office for weeks the film has seduced frightened provoked and moved audiences with the depth of its focus on the delinquency of a despairing youth. A stylized mixture of cruelty and compassion Confessions deals with school violence bullying revenge and love while also addressing the miserable state of Japanese public schools prejudices against HIV victims and the consequences of allowing teenage violence to go unpunished.\nA monologue is delivered over the usual chaos of a seventh grade classroom on a spring morning. The voice belongs to a teacher who stands powerless in front of her class an undisciplined tangle of thirteen-year-olds playing with their mobile phones shouting moving around and simply not paying attention. But the teacher?s voice and her chilling address gradually become more and more disturbing. She announces that she is going to leave the school at the end of the month. A single mother overwhelmed by the death of her daughter she cannot work any longer because she knows her child was killed by two of her own students.\nThe murderers are too young to be tried for their crimes and the teacher will not reveal their names nor turn them in. Post-traumatic shock and detachment seem to have granted her an immense power and searing lucidity. Her revenge will be painfully pure.\nBased on the bestselling novel Kohuhaku by Kanae Minato Confessions reveals the key mystery in its opening sequence and then focuses on the reasons that prompted this violent act and subsequent vendetta. Shifting between the point of view of the teenagers and the devastated grieving teacher Nakashima prevents the audience from taking sides allowing the viewers room to come to their own conclusions about the dark acts they witness.\"\nQuoting Giovanna Fulvi from the 2010 Toronto International Film Festival site.""lang":"/lang/en"}]"id":"/wikipedia/ja_id/2610269"} redoneMovieRating : 9(7.9), redoneBookRating : 9(3.8),
